Important:
- Close all dialogs (like logging) before entering fullscreen to prevent dead-lock with D3D

- Many games show emulation warnings in the log window (unaligned read, bad read/write address)
 - Test: Metroid Fusion, Advance Wars 2

- Gfx.cpp/h optimization
 - Test: Final Fantasy 4 airship intro

- Improve automatic 64k/128k flash save detection

- HQ3x/4x ASM implementation produces wrong interpolation on the image's border
 - This has already been fixed in the C version; look at hq_base.h / line 343 - 372. The ASM version most likely only has something like skipLine instead of skipLinePlus and skipLineMinus, which is however necessary in order to work correctly.

- Fix OpenGL issues

- Remove 16 bit hack for filters
 - Not compatible to software motion blur (display corruption)

- Add selection for compressed archives with more than one ROM in them



Less important:
- Add GBA cheat editing support (GB already has)
 - Look at Cheats.cpp (Core) and GBACheats.cpp (GUI)

- Support D3DFMT_A2R10G10B10 (10 bit per color component) color format

- Add documentation for VBA-M (configuration guide)

- Improve AVI recording (produces asynchronous files)

- Enable audio stream compression for AVI files

- Add stereo upmixing support to OpenAL

- Verify BIOS files by checksum instead by file extension

- Merge HQ2x/LQ2x C code into code for HQ3x/4x

- Apply pixel filter to sprites and BG seperately for better image quality

- Create Visual Studio project using SDL makefile



Performance:
- Apply HQ3x/4x optimizations from C version to ASM version

- Apply pixel filter only to changed parts of the image

- Make use of multi-core CPUs

- Make use of 64 bit CPUs

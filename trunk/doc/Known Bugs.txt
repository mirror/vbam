Known Bugs:

- Linking: Doesnt work quite right yet.
- OpenGL: Custom fragment/vertex shaders do not work quite as well as original test build (Mudlord)
- OpenGL: Custom fullscreen resolutions will not work when filters are enabled. 
  - Since other fullscreen OGL reses are disabled, I should disable custom OGL resolution
    switching (Mudlord).
- OpenGL: Various context handling issues with OGL mode. The emulator should restart whenever is
  enabled, thus eliminating these issues when switching graphics APIs. I don't why this didnt happen
  in the first place, when it should. (Mudlord)
- Audio core: assertation error occurs when disabling GB sound
  - I think its best we mute sound instead, since some games rely on audio for timing.
    Plus, blargg's GB_Snd_Emu is extremely optimized stuff. (Mudlord)
- Wrong bit depth image is displayed for 2 frames when switching from/to HQ3x/4x ASM
 - This is caused by the 16bit hack which does not re-process the emulated image.
   It results in the display devices treating the image at pix with the wrong bit depth.

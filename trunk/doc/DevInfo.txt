Known preprocessor switches:
- SDL: Defined for the SDL version
- GBA_LOGGING: Enables logging for the GBA core
- FINAL_VERSION: Defined for release versions, disables additional GBA logging and completely disables GB logging. Increases the amount of CPU cycles being emulated in one go.
- BKPT_SUPPORT
- MMX: Enable MMX instruction set
- NO_ASM: Use C++ version of hq3x/4x filters
- RGB555: Use 16bit colors with 5bit green instead of 6bit green in hq3x/4x filters (C++ version)
- NO_OGL: Exclude OpenGL code
- NO_D3D: Exclude Direct3D code
- NO_OAL: Exclude OpenAL code
- NO_XAUDIO2: Exclude XAudio2 code (supersedes DirectSound)

# Visual C++ 2008 project files #
#################################

There are two solution files for Visual C++ 2008:

===Win32/MFC===
The Windows MFC GUI version project files are located in the root of the VBA-M sources (VBA2008.sln).
In order to compile it, you have to compile zlib and libpng first and set your compiler's INCLUDE and LIB path accordantly.
You also need Microsoft's DirectX SDK (At least for DirectInput).
If you want to enable OpenAL sound output, install the OpenAL SDK. If you do not want it, #define NO_OAL.
Some pixel filters come with assembler code compatible to the NASM syntax. Extract NASM somewhere and add it to your PATH environment variable. All .asm files should be handled with the "nasm.rules" build rules file, also in the source root.

===Win32/Qt===
The MS Visual C++ 2008 Express-compatible project file can be found in /project/vc2008.
It uses the qmake file in /project/qmake.
IMPORTANT: The Qt-sources have to be compiled with the Microsoft compiler first, in order to use it. The default distribution was compiled with mingw and will not work with the MS Compiler.
The dependencies folder is not (yet) necessary.

Known Bugs:

- Linking: Doesnt work quite right yet.
- OpenGL: Fragment shaders do not work quite as well as original test build (Mudlord)
- Audio core: assertation error occurs when disabling GB sound
- x64: Needs optimizations (x64 native code, whatever)
- Wrong bit depth image is displayed for 2 frames when switching from/to HQ3x/4x ASM
 - This is caused by the 16bit hack which does not re-process the emulated image.
   It results in the display devices treating the image at pix with the wrong bit depth.

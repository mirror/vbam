Known Bugs:

- Linking: Doesnt work quite right yet.
- OpenGL: Fragment shaders do not work quite as well as original test build (Mudlord)
- Audio core: assertation error occurs when disabling GB sound
- x64: Needs optimizations (x64 native code, whatever)
- Wrong bit depth image is displayed for some frames when switching from/to Hq3x/4x ASM (most probably caused by 16bit to 32bit hack)

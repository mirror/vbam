Important:
- HQ3x/4x ASM implementation produces wrong interpolation on the image's border
 - This has already been fixed in the C version; look at hq_base.h / line 343 - 372. The ASM version most likely only has something like skipLine instead of skipLinePlus and skipLineMinus, which is however necessary in order to work correctly.


Unimportant:
- DDraw, D3D, OGL: Add full screen device & frequency selection
- Verify BIOS files by checksums instead by file extension

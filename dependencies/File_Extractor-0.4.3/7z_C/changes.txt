Changes to 7z_C source
----------------------
I made several minor changes:

* Hard-coded setup to _SZ_ONE_DIRECTORY, _LZMA_IN_CB, _LZMA_LOC_OPT

* Fixed several memory free functions to not access NULL when cleaning
up after a failed allocation.

* Made private functions static.

* Fixed SzArchiveOpen to properly report error when header can't be
read.

* Fixed glaring conflicts between LzmaTypes.h and 7zTypes.h.

* Allow extraction of archive using BJC x86 filter, but the filter is
IGNORED since it's not supported by the non-beta C version of 7z
extractor. I encountered an archive that apparently erroneously claimed
to use this filter, yet it extracts all data correct if it's ignored.

Known preprocessor switches
===========================

- SDL: Defined for the SDL version
- GBA_LOGGING: Enables logging for the GBA core
- FINAL_VERSION: Defined for release versions, disables additional GBA logging and completely disables GB logging. Increases the amount of CPU cycles being emulated in one go.
- BKPT_SUPPORT
- MMX: Enable MMX instruction set

Download locations
==================

Qt:     http://trolltech.com/developer/downloads/qt/windows
UPX:    http://upx.sourceforge.net/
zlib:   http://zlib.net/

=============================
Visual C++ 2008 project files
=============================

There are project files available for Microsoft's Visual C++ IDE/compiler.
Refer to the instructions below for further assistance:

The MS Visual C++ 2008 Express-compatible project file can be found in project/vc2008_qt.
It uses the qmake file in project/qmake, so you always have to add files to the VC++ project file AND the qmake file!
IMPORTANT: The Qt-sources have to be compiled with the Microsoft compiler first, in order to use it,
because Trolltech only provides MinGW compatible binaries which are incompatible to the MS Compiler.
Continue by reading "How to compile Qt from source with Visual C++ 2008".
The release build will automatically be compressed with UPX, make sure to download it and point MSVC++ to it.


==================================================
How to compile Qt from source with Visual C++ 2008
==================================================

- Download the latest Qt source code archive
 - You want "qt-win-opensource-src-x.x.x.zip", not "qt-win-opensource-x.x.x-mingw.exe"
 - This how-to was witten when Qt 4.4.1 was the current version. 
- Extract the archive somewhere.
- Start a Visual Studio build command promt and cd to the extracted files.
 - You can find it in the start menu in "Microsoft Visual Studio 2008\Visual Studio Tools\Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt".
- Type & run "configure -release -fast -no-qt3support -platform win32-msvc2008"
- When configure finished, simply run "nmake" and get yourself a coffee or ten.
- When nmake finished and you've become a coffee addict, add the created lib files to your Visual Studio paths, do the same for the include paths.

To Do List
==========

###Important###
- Many games show emulation warnings in the log window (unaligned read, bad read/write address)
 - Test: Metroid Fusion, Advance Wars 2

- Gfx.cpp/h optimization
 - Test: Final Fantasy 4 airship intro

- Improve automatic 64k/128k flash save detection

- Add support for byuu's UPS patching format to replace IPS

- Add selection for compressed archives with more than one ROM in them

- Fix LCD colouring

- Game Bugs:
* Drymouth - screen flashes black after certain scanline
* World Reborn - 2 graphics bugs

###Less important###
- Add documentation for VBA-M (configuration guide)

- Improve AVI recording (produces asynchronous files)

- Enable audio stream compression for AVI files

- Verify BIOS files by checksum instead by file extension

- Apply pixel filter to sprites and BG seperately for better image quality

###Performance###
- Apply pixel filter only to changed parts of the image

- Make use of multi-core CPUs
